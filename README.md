## Role Playing Game (RPG)
Ever wonder how the games from today's generation create an immersive experience with developing storylines, impactful decision making, and astounding graphics came to be? This project focuses on developing a console based RPG Game that allows the user to make decisions that ultimately affect the outcome of their game.

## Object Oriented Programming
Role Playing Games all start from somewhere and what better to understand Object Oriented Programming then developing a RPG game! This project focuses on understanding the concepts of objects, class methods, class variables, and polymorphism. 

## Entities and Game States
All entity objects are confined into one game state, where the user can make decisions based on their character. Class methods and polymorphism allow users to ignore the low-level details of implementation and focus on the individual methods that work together like a well-oiled machine to create a holistic game experience.
